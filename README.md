### Labwork 1 - Integrated Telecommunications Networks at FCT-NOVA
Proposed by Professor Lu√≠s Bernardo


### Objectives
Familiarization with the operation of routers in a mesh network. The work consists in the communication between components interconnected
in a mesh network. In this paper we imagine that the stations are using a mesh network over the physical Ethernet network.
The task is to develop a router program that can communicate with neighboring routers by providing a forwarding service
based on a line state algorithm resulting from the simplification of the OSPFv2 algorithm (Open Shortest Path First), used on TCP / IP networks.
